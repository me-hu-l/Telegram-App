# Telegram-App

Voiceflow is a designing, prototyping and build platform for voice apps, which can be used as a voice interface for your voice apps, however it only allows 2 projects at a time, Hence I am giving the recording of working of the project here.

Make(formerly known as Integromat) is used to connect applications accross various services, which I have used to connect the app to my evernote account using Telegram API
